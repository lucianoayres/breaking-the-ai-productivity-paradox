## About the Book üìñ

_Breaking the AI Productivity Paradox_ explores why powerful AI tools often fail to deliver expected gains in enterprise software development‚Äîand how to overcome those obstacles.

With hands-on frameworks and practical playbooks, this book equips CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and team leads with the strategies, processes, and governance needed to:

- Understand the root causes of the AI productivity gap
- Select and integrate both ‚Äúsmart‚Äù IDE assistants (Copilot, CodeWhisperer) and agentic tools (Cursor AI, Windsurf)
- Cultivate a culture of adoption, trust, and continuous learning
- Align AI with SDLC phases, DevOps pipelines, and governance models
- Measure impact with balanced KPIs and calculate real ROI

Whether you‚Äôre launching a pilot or scaling across hundreds of developers, this guide helps you turn AI hype into measurable software development wins.
